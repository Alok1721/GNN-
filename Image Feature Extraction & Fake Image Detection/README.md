Goal: Extract image features using pre-trained CNNs (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) and use them to detect manipulated or fake images.
Tasks:

Use a pre-trained CNN model to extract features from images associated with news articles.
Implement a simple classifier to detect fake/manipulated images based on extracted features. Objective: Learn how to work with image data and use CNNs for feature extraction, which will complement multi-modal misinformation detection.
