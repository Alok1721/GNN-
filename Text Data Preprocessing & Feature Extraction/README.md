Goal: Build a pipeline for preprocessing textual data, including tokenization, stopwords removal, lemmatization, and Named Entity Recognition (NER).
Tasks:

Implement text preprocessing for news articles or social media posts.
Use a transformer model (BERT/DistilBERT) to generate text embeddings.
Store the preprocessed text data and embeddings in a structured format for further analysis. Objective: Learn how to preprocess and extract features from textual data, which is a crucial step in misinformation detection.
