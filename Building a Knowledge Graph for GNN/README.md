Goal: Construct a basic knowledge graph using news articles or public data and train a simple GNN model to learn node and edge embeddings.
Tasks:

Define nodes as articles, authors, sources, and keywords.
Define edges based on content similarity, co-authorship, and shared keywords.
Use a GNN model (GraphSAGE or GAT) to process the graph and learn node representations. Objective: Familiarize yourself with graph construction, embeddings, and basic GNN operations.
