Goal: Implement a binary classification model (Fake vs. Real news) using text-based features from pre-trained transformers (like BERT or RoBERTa).
Tasks:

Train a classifier on labeled news datasets (e.g., Fake News Dataset).
Preprocess text data and fine-tune a transformer-based model for binary classification.
Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Objective: Understand how to apply machine learning models for misinformation detection.
